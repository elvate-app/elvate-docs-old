### What is DCA ?

Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy in which the intention is to minimize the impact of volatility when investing or purchasing a large block of a financial asset or instrument. It is also called unit cost averaging, incremental averaging, or cost average effect.

### How Elvate can help ?

DCAing on DEX can be expensive. If each transaction implies fees, it can be not really worth it to buy small amount.

Elvate help to reduce fees when DCAing. To archive this, Elvate is using a Pair system where users can register with the amount of their choice. Each Pairs can be triggered once a week, that will make a purchase for all subscribed users . The person who trigger receive a small amount of fees for incentive. So it's not the subscriber who necessarily pay the fees, and there is only one transaction for all subscribers.

With this method, An Elvate user can simply deposit and subscribe to a Pair, with only two transactions and he will automatically DCA with lower fees than other tools.
